		<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

		<p>
			I was tasked with not only updating the branding on the homepages for the <a href="https://arkencounter.com/" target="_blank">Ark Encounter</a><span class="material-icons icon-sm icon-link">link</span>
			and <a href="https://creationmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Creation Museum</a><span class="material-icons icon-sm icon-link">link</span> sister attractions, but also finding UX solutions
			to display the current operating hours of the attractions and to allow space for announcements.
		</p>
		<p>
			My solution was to add a new section below the hero photo to house our most important info. The first section
			was reserved for the ticketing CTA. It was important for that to be above the fold on all devices. The second section
			is optional, and allows space for any announcements (currently our Covid-19 health info). The third section was the perfect place
			for our hours. This placement was much more ideal since hours only appeared in the footer previously.
